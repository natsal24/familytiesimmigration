.ve-header "Family Ties: Immigration" background=#124559

Immigration is a topic that has presented itself numerous times in our Family Ties interviews. I consider it a topic that impacts various people both directly and indirectly. Despite the reasons that one choses to or is forced to immigrate it naturally alters the trajectory of a family history, for better or even for worse.  Here I have complied extracts of interviews where the immigration of a family member or two, is an important factor of the story being shared with us.

All too frequently people are forced to immigrate due to violence occuring in their home countries. The decision to leave is usually met with desperation and necessity. This was the case for Tifanny Keo's mother, Dorothy Dip. Tiffany sat down with us to share the story of her mother who is a survivor of the ==Cambodian Genocide=={Q2885072} (1975-1979). The genocide began when Dorothy was just a child. Everything she knew as her home would quickly change. Dorothy's immigration story is one of survival. The decision to leave was a matter of life or death. She went to a refugee camp in Thailand as a child where she received a formal education for the first time in her life. At school in Thailand she met a teacher that believed in her talents and helped her learn English. This passion she had for learning continues to accompany her even untill today. Dorothy and her family would later go to the Philippines and lastly, they immigrated to the United States in 1983.  

Layla Ahmed's grandparents, Mohammed and Shirin Talukder, have a similar story of immigrating to survive. In 1971, only a few weeks after getting married, Layla's grandparents had to face the unimaginable. Mohammed was working as a doctor in Koitok Hospital and as was customary of the time Shirin went home to visit her family after the wedding. While the newlyweds were separated the ==Bagladesh Liberation War (1971)=={Q371394} broke out and the couple was unaware if the other was dead or alive. Each of them had interesting experiences during the war. Shirin and her family had to flee their home because Shirin's father had been the former capitan of the West Pakistan Army and they feared the army would be looking for him. And back at the hospital Mohammed was secretly sending supplies to the Freedom Fighters behind the backs of the West Pakistan Army which had taken over the hospital as their own camp. Shirin and Mohammed were reunited and once the war was over they decided to establish themselves in another country while Bangladesh got back on it's feet.

They first moved to Lagos, Nigeria where Mohammad was able to continue his medical career. After many years the family tried to immigrate to Dublin only to find that Mohammed's doctor's license was not valid there so they tried their luck in England only to find themselves in the same situaiton. The family had to move back to Nigeria with the plan of immigrating to the United States where Shirin had a sister living. In the U.S. Shirin worked at an electronics factory and Mohammed stayed at home with their youngest son. In later years the couple had their own small business. Their original plan of moving back to Bangladesh never came to fruition and Mohammed had to come to terms with the fact that he wouldn't be a practicing doctor in his new country. Despite the obstacles they felt that all the sacrifices they made were worth it because of the opportunities and safety afforded to them in the United States.
