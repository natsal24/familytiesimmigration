#Immigration 

Immigration is a topic that has come up many times in our Family Ties interviews. I consider it a topic that impacts numerous people both directly and indirectly. Despite the reasons that one choses to or is forced to immigrate it naturally alters the trajectory of a family history, for better or even for worse.  Here I have complied extracts of interviews where the immigration of a family member or two, is an important factor of the story being shared with us.

All too frequently people are forced to immigrate due to violence occuring in their home countries. The decision to leave is usually met with desperation and necessity. This was the case for Tifanny Keo's mother, Dorothy Dip. Tiffany sat down with us to share the story of her mother who is a survivor of the ==Cambodian Genocide=={Q2885072} (1975-1979). The genocide began when Dorothy was just a child. Everything she knew as her home would quickly begin to change. Dorothy's immigration story is one of survival. The decision to leave was a matter of life or death. She went to a refugee camp in Thailand as a child where she received a formal education for the first time in her life. At school in Thailand she met a teacher that believed in her talents and helped her learn English. This spark she had for knowledge and learning continues to accompany her even till today. Dorothy and her family would later go to the Philippines and lastly, they immigrated to the United States in 1983.  
Layla Ahmed's grandparents have a similar story of immigrating to survive. Only a few weeks after getting married Layla's grandparents, Mohammed and Shirin Talukder, had to face the unimaginable.
