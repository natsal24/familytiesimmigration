#Immigration 

Immigration is a topic that has come up many times in our Family Ties interviews. I consider it a topic that impacts numerous people both directly and indirectly. Despite the reasons that one choses to or is forced to immigrate it naturally alters the trajectory of a family history, for better or even for worse.  Here I have complied extracts of interviews where the immigration of a family member or two, is an important factor of the story being shared with us.

#### **Immigration to Survive **

All too frequently people are forced to immigrate due to violence occuring in their home countries. The decision to leave is usually met with desperation and necessity. This was the case for Tifanny Keo's mother, Dorothy Dip. Tiffant sat down with us to share the story of her mother who is a survivor of the ==Cambodian Genocide=={Q2885072} (1975-1979). The genocide began when Dorothy was just a girl, but everything she knew as her home would quickly begin to change. Dorothy's immigration story is one of survival where there was no time to decide what do to next. The next step was to leave her homeland behind if her and her family wanted to survive. She went to a ==refugee camp in Thailand== {Q8645543}  as a child where she was able to continue getting her education. There she met a teacher that truly believed in her talents and helped her learn English. Dorothy and her family would later go to the Philippines and lastly, they would immigrante to the United States in 1983.
