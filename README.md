#Immigration 

Immigration is a topic that has come up many times in our Family Ties interviews. I consider it a topic that impacts numerous people both directly and indirectly. Despite the reasons that one choses to or is forced to immigrate it naturally alters the trajectory of a family history, for better or even for worse.  Here I have complied extracts of interviews where the immigration of a family member or two, is an important factor of the story being shared with us.

All too frequently people are forced to immigrate due to violence occuring in their home countries. The decision to leave is usually met with desperation and necessity. This was the case with Tifanny Keo's mother, Dorothy Dip. Dorothy is a survivor of the ==Cambidian Genocide=={Q2885072} (1975-1979). The genocide began when she was just a girl, but everything Dorothy knew as her home, would quickly begin to change. Dorothy was a witness to many murders including the murder of her own brother.
