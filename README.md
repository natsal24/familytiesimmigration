#Immigration 

Immigration is a topic that has come up many times in Family Ties interviews. I consider it a topic that impacts numerous people both directly and indirectly. Despite the reasons that one choses to or is forced to immigrate it naturally alters the trajectory of a family history, for better or even for worse.  Here I have complied extracts of interviews where the immigration of a family member or two, is an important factor of the story.

All too often people are forced to immigrate due to violence that they are living through in their home countries. The decision to immigrate is usually met with desperation as was the case with Tifanny Keo's mother, Dorothy Dip.
